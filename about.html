            <h1> Who am I ?</h1>
            <p>I always loved philosophical questions, but this is not one of those.<br>
                I am a Service Engineer with expertise in Electrical engineering, an aspiring programmer, a DevOps Acolyte and an InfoSec initiate.
                Fiddling with mechanical repairs and micro electronic design is a hobby of mine (even though I am a little rusty in microelectronic)
            <br>I was born and raised in italy and moved to the USA in 2012, and after that i travelled along the east coast, living in Greenville SC, Boston MA and landing finally in New Jersey.
                I believe to be a great asset for any company, with a great learning capability (not sure if comparable to Unit 8200 but I can definitely learn a lot in a short amount of time.
